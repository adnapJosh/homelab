This took me a few days of failed configurations to finally figure out.  

**PiVPN Attmepts**  
Intially I had used this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9sWhnYQvpE), which used [PiVPN](https://www.pivpn.io/) as a method of adding Wireguard to an Ubuntu LXC.
Unfortunately I wasn't able to correctly conffigure it after multiple attempts using this method.
I'm still unsure what the exact problem was that caused my connections to not link, but I belived it had to do with either an IP mismatch between the peer and interface.
(Although I made sure to always make sure they were configured correctly)
